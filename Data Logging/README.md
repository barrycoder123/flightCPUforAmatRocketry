README: Data Logging
Team Celestial Blue
Senior Design Project
Tufts University, 2023

The code in this directory implements data logging for our Flight Computer. This README explains the purpose of each file. See each file for more specifics. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

data_logger.py
- Implements a data logging class which writes output data to a file. Supports plotting as well

data_viewer.py
- Can be used to view the contents of a data file after navigation. Ideally you'd copy the data file from the Flgiht Computer to your own PC, and then view it with this python script.
- TODO: not yet implemented

old files
- Folder which contains old files, not needed anymore
