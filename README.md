Flight Algorithms:
- Contains code for Kalman filtering, the IMU strapdown, a quaternion library, and Earth model (reference frames and conversions)

Data Collection:
- Contains code which deals with getting input data from sensors and .csv files

Data Logging:
- Contains code which deals with saving output data to .csv files

Testing & Validation:
- Contains code that can only run on a PC, good for quick debugging/validation
- Contains code that can be run actual flight computer FOR TESTING ONLY

Main Functions:
- Contains code that should be run actual flight computer for final usage

Unit Tests:
- Contains a few unit tests
