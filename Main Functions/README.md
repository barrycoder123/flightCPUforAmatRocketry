The code in this directory "Scripts & Main Functions" implements the finite state machines for our Flight Computer. The idea is that each file in this directory will be executed when you are actually using the Flight Computer for navigational purposes. This README explains the purpose of each file. See each file for more specifics. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ground_test_state_machine.py
- You should execute this file on the Flight Computer if you are going to navigate on the surface of the Earth.
- Run with python3 ground_test_state_machine.py

active_flight_state_machine.py:
- Hypothetically you'd execute this file if you are going to launch it on an actual rocket
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT launch this on a rocket. Do not attempt to run this script, it will not work.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to run:
- Open up your favorite Python IDE (we use Spyder) and run one of these scripts
- If using a text editor, you can run python3 [filename].py. no command line arguments
