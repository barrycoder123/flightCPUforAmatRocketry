The code in this directory "Main Functions" implements state machines for our Flight Computer. The idea is that each file in this directory will be executed when you are actually using the Flight Compute for navigational purposes. This README explains the purpose of each file. See each file for more specifics. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

flight_state_machine.py:
- Hypothetically you'd execute this file if you are going to launch it on an actual rocket
- IMPORTANT: the software is not ready. do NOT launch this on a rocket

ground_test_state_machine.py
- You should execute this file if you are going to navigate on the surface of the Earth using the Flight Computer.
