The code in this repository implements simulations for our Flight Computer. The idea is that each file in this directory would be run on your PC for easy debugging/validation. This README explains the purpose of each file. See each file for more specifics.

kalman_simulation.py:
- Run this on the Flight Computer to test Kalman Filtering

strapdown_simulation.py
- Run this on the Flight Computer to test the IMU strapdown
